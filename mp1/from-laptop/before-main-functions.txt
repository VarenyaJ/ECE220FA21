; example code has character -> space -> frequency
; use left shift? to calculate amount of letters  
; need to turn 4 binary bits into 1 hex bit then print out

; R0 = output/print function
; R1 = Hold the character that needs to be printed in here
; R2 = Use this for the digit counter
; R3 = Probably need another counter for bin-to-hex conversion
; R4 = (counter for) # of rows (maybe look at ECE120 lab 11 and 13)
; R5 = use to hold address of the binary digit to be printed
; R6 = just use as a temp register to move stuff around


; DO NOT USE R7, it is used for special trap commands (Prof. Moon's notes)
